# saturnData
graph data on saturns ring distribution using python, mathplotlib.pyplot, and seaborn

This is a demonstration of a few learning concepts from my intro to data science class.
The intent was to source data about Saturns ring systems from NASA, clean the data for
any N/A values, filter the data to Features, Inner and Outer boundaries and plot data
using python, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, and seaborn

Future work may include a webscraper script that goes to NASA to get the data for me,
as a proof of concept, not necessarily as a difficult/useful task.
